 [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/jetstream/Vehicle-DB)](https://repl.it/github/jetstream0/Vehicle-DB)
Create database of vehicles using nhsta api 
It takes a bit of time to get all the vehicles (A LONG TIME), so I suggest you only fetch the vehicle types you need.
Thank you government agency for making this cool api. 
Also, please open an issue if something is broken.
